# Aisle Eight
Aisle Eight is a web app with the goal to make grocery shopping both more time and cost efficient.
Initial setup includes adding stores, aisles in those stores, and then items. Once that is complete items can be placed in aisles and given costs, sizes, descriptions, etc. From there it is easy to make a shopping list that is organized and takes advantage of the best pricing. That list can be easily used as a checklist in the store(s) for a smooth shopping experience.
